# Air-Pollution-Forecasting---LSTM-Multivariate

About Dataset
THE MISSION
The story behind the dataset is how to apply LSTM architecture to understand and apply multiple variables together to contribute more accuracy towards forecasting.

THE CONTENT
Air Pollution Forecasting
The Air Quality dataset.

This is a dataset that reports on the weather and the level of pollution each hour for five years at the US embassy in Beijing, China.

The data includes the date-time, the pollution called PM2.5 concentration, and the weather information including dew point, temperature, pressure, wind direction, wind speed and the cumulative number of hours of snow and rain. The complete feature list in the raw data is as follows:

No: row number
year: year of data in this row
month: month of data in this row
day: day of data in this row
hour: hour of data in this row
pm2.5: PM2.5 concentration
DEWP: Dew Point
TEMP: Temperature
PRES: Pressure
cbwd: Combined wind direction
Iws: Cumulated wind speed
Is: Cumulated hours of snow
Ir: Cumulated hours of rain
We can use this data and frame a forecasting problem where, given the weather conditions and pollution for prior hours, we forecast the pollution at the next hour.
